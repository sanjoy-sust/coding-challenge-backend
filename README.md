# AM Coding Challenge - Backend (Flask)

## The case study: Application review

Reviewing applications is one of the key activities, when starting a new project.
To takle that challenge, BP ACCELERATOR Inc. wants to provide an API, via which applicant can hand in their application with past project experience.

The software stores the data in a data base and generates a document, so the application can be reviewed by the HR department

## Product Requirements

As an applicant at BP ACCELERATOR Inc.,

- [ ] I want to provide my application via a REST-API, with the following data:
  - [ ] my work e-mail address
  - [ ] a name
  - [ ] a github user
  - [ ] past projects (min 1)
- [ ] for each past project I want to provide
  - [ ] name of the project
  - [ ] employment mode (options: freelance / employed)
  - [ ] capacity (options: part-time / full-time)
  - [ ] duration in months (allow to provide weeks)
  - [ ] start year
  - [ ] role
  - [ ] team size (number)
  - [ ] link to the repository (optional)
  - [ ] link to the live url (optional)

As an application reviewer at BP ACCELERATOR Inc.,

- [ ] I want to see all applications in a database
- [ ] I want the database to contain a PDF document for each applicant, that lists the data provided from the applicant
- [ ] I want that when new data for an e-mail address is provided, all old data is automatically deleted 

## Your Mission

Create a Flask application that satisfies all must-have requirements above, plus any nice-to-have requirements you wish to include.

For that, you'll need to provide a REST-API, set up a database and generate a PDF document, that contains the applicants data.

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer, but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favorite tools and packages to build a solid Flask application.

You don't have to host your service publicly, but feel free to do that.
Please include a description in the README.md how to run the project locally and provide us a well done description for the API.
